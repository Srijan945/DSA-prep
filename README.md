# DSA 6-Week Algorithm Mastery Plan (Intermediate)

👇 Designed for someone already comfortable with coding basics

Week 1 — Foundations + Patterns

- Sliding window
- Binary search patterns
- Prefix/suffix
- Two-pointer

Practice:
- LC patterns lists (min 20 problems)

Week 2 — Graphs

- BFS / DFS
- Topological Sort
- Dijkstra
- 0-1 BFS
- BFS on grid (classic patterns)

Problems: 15–20

Week 3 — DP Basics

- 1D DP
- Grid DP
- Knapsack family
- LIS (DP + binary search)

Problems: 20

Week 4 — Advanced Data Structures

- Segment Tree
- Fenwick Tree
- Disjoint Set Union

Problems: 15

Week 5 — Advanced Graphs

- MST (Kruskal / Prim)
- Bridges / Articulation points
- Shortest path variants (Bellman Ford)

Problems: 15

Week 6 — Mixed + Revision

- AtCoder DP contest subset
- Timed contests
- Review weaker topics
- Target: At least 2 contests/week

⭐ Extra Tips (for intermediates leveling up)

- Write code from memory every weekend — refresh templates
- Maintain “Mistakes Log” (VERY OP)
- Solve 1 hard/week — even if takes hours
- Discuss problems — you retain 2× better

## Patterns

### Patterns in Coding

| Data Structure | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Normal array | Prefix, Suffix Sum, Sliding window, Math |
| 2D Array | Row sum, Column sum |

### Patterns in SQL

| Pattern / Feature | Purpose / Notes |
|---|---|
| Case clause | Create runtime columns based on conditions |
| Join | Generate cumulative tables or combine related data via different join types |
| Subquery | Extract a subset of data for further processing |
| Limit / Offset / Fetch Next | Handle "top N" or paginated results also, mostly used in single query result not with group by |
| Window functions | rank(), dense_rank(), row_number(), etc. — apply calculations across a set of rows |
| Aggregate functions used with Group By a lot | SUM(), MAX(), AVG(), etc. — compute cumulative/summary answers |
