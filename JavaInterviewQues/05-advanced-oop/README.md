# Advanced OOP Concepts — Q&A

55. What is polymorphism?
- Ability to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (compile-time and runtime).

56. What is the use of instanceof operator in Java?
- To test if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.

57. What is coupling?
- Degree of interdependence between modules; lower is better.

58. What is cohesion?
- Degree to which elements within a module belong together; higher is better.

59. What is encapsulation?
- Hiding internal state and exposing behavior via methods (use of access modifiers).

60. What is an inner class?
- A class defined within another class (non-static nested class).

61. What is a static inner class?
- A nested class declared static; doesn't have implicit reference to outer instance.

62. Can you create an inner class inside a method?
- Yes, local inner classes can be defined inside methods.

63. What is an anonymous class?
- A one-off local class without a name, typically used to implement an interface or extend a class inline.
